#Read Me document for Getting and Cleaning Data Project

In the Getting and Cleaning Data Project repository there are a 3 documents. Two documents are mark delimited called ReadMe.md and CodeBook.md, one is an R code called run_analysis.R. 
The purpose of the project was to create tidy data set of the multiple data files found in the below link in file folder UCI HAR Dataset.

Decription data used: Data set is of 30 volunteers monitoring walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying on a Samsun Galaxy.

Data Source: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 


Below states what was done in R programming in the file run_analysis.R:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
